# Multiplicative Persistence
This code is made by an amateur, so it might be messy, confusing and sometimes it may also work as well. All the information I gathered in order to make this code does not come
from those awful bricks of paper called "books". I mainly looked for some information on wikipedia.

# How does the code work?
The code will generate a set of number according to the settings of the user. At the beginning, there is a constant defined as "nines". It tells the amount 9's that must be in 
the number that will be generated (nines=1 by default). The first two digits can be between 2 and 9, while the remaining digits must be either 7 or 8 (as said before, 9's are 
already defined). The list will include all the possible numbers. Then (hopefully) the code will output the lowest number with the highest multiplicative persistence between
the generated numbers.

# Is it really useful?
Well, I don't know, it might help better understanding maths, maybe. I'm just having fun, though.
